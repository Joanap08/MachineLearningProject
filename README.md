# MachineLearningProject
Final project 

Goal:The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which 6 individuals exercised using data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell and apply it to 20 different test cases and check which machine learning algorithm shows better performance for this task.

Steps followed to build the model.

1. Step - Explore the dataset, its dimensions and distribution
2. Step - Cleaning the dataset from missing values and not accountable variables for our study goal.
3. Step - Using K-fold cross validation to increase the performance of our model
4. Step - Experimenting Different Machine Learning Algorithms 
5. Step - Checking the models performance in order to choose the best performer
6. Step - Apply the best performer to the dataset test partioned to evaluate its performance as predictor.
7. Step - Finally apply the model built to the 20 cases where "CLASSE" was unknown and check its performance for the matter
8. Step - Conclusion
